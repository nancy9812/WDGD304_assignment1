      <h2>Universal Language</h2>
      <p>Out of all the languages out there in the world, music is the only language that everyone can understand.
        People don't necessarily need to understand the lyrics to understand the feeling of a song.</p>

      <h2>Community</h2>
      <p>Music has a way to bring people together; whether it be by sharing the same taste in music, or even bonding
        over one song. Sharing music on social media and following certain musicians can connect you to people and make
        more friends and acquaintances. Music can connect you to people from all around the world.</p>

      <h2>Mental Health</h2>
      <p>Music can improve your mood and also keep you focused if it is played in the background. It is also beneficial
        when used for music therapy, which is becoming popular all around the world. Music has shown benefits for many
        mental health conditions like depression, trauma, anxiety, schizophrenia, and many others. Sometimes when you
        are feeling down and listen to some sad songs, it can even make your mood a bit better because you understand
        the lyrics/feeling of the song more. </p>

      <h2>Creativity</h2>
      <p>Music also helps people expand on their creativity and imagination. When you hear the melody of a song or
        understand the lyrics of a song, it can get your brain's creative juices flowing to create something else.</p>

      <h2>Memory</h2>
      <p>Music can also improve memory! I'm sure that many people can remember lyrics of a song that you like or listen
        to frequently more than an article that you read recently. Even when you hear a song that you have heard a long
        time ago, it give you some memories of those times where you would listen to the song.</p>

      <h2>Ambience</h2>
      <p>Imagine going to a restaurant without some type of music playing in the background or a party without music; it
        would probably feel awkward. Music is everywhere from movies to sports games and everywhere in between. </p>
